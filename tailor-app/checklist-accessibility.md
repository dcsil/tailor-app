| Guideline                                         | Description of how you accommodated this                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.1.1 – Non-text Content                         |All images have an alternative text description (title, file name, logo).                                                              |
| 1.2.1 – Audio-only and Video-only (Pre-recorded) |No video or audio-only content in the app.                                                              |
| 1.2.2 – Captions (Pre-recorded)                  |No video or audio-only content in the app.                                                              |
| 1.2.3 – Audio Description or Media Alternative (Pre-recorded) |No video-only content in the app.                                                      |
| 1.3.1 – Info and Relationships                   |Appropriate HTML tags and headings are used to define sections of the page.                                                               |
| 1.3.2 – Meaningful Sequence                      |The main page features a text box for entering prompts and navigates to the mood board page, where users can make additional edits, add content, perform analysis, and export results. The collections page allows users to view their past uploads and saved mood boards.                                                             |
| 1.3.3 – Sensory Characteristics                  |Instructions do not rely on sensory cues, as button labels use clear, descriptive text to convey their purpose and avoid reliance on color or sound.                                                              |
| 1.4.1 – Use of Colour                            |Buttons do not rely on color alone to convey their purpose. As for each color in the palette generated alongside the mood board, both its name and corresponding Pantone Matching System (PMS) code are included for clarity and accessibility.                                                                |
| 1.4.2 – Audio Control                            |No audio-only content in the app.                                                               |
| 2.1.1 – Keyboard                                 |The keyboard can be used to switch between links and buttons on the page and navigate to other pages.                                                              |
| 2.1.2 – No Keyboard Trap                         |The Tab key on the keyboard can be used to cycle through components on the page, and pressing Enter allows navigation to other links.                                                              |
| 2.2.1 – Timing Adjustable                        |No time-sensitive features or contents in the app.                                                  |
| 2.2.2 – Pause, Stop, Hide                        |No moving or auto-updating content in the app.                                                              |
| 2.3.1 – Three Flashes or Below                   |No falshy content in the app.                                                              |
| 2.4.1 – Bypass Blocks                            |Since our app has minimal navigation links, a 'skip to content' link is not necessary.                                                   |
| 2.4.2 – Page Titled                              |The app contains a few key pages. The main page can be accessed via the tailor button located at the top-left of the navbar. The buttons for navigating to the collections and account pages are clearly labeled. Additionally, the purpose of the other buttons on the mood board is clearly communicated through their labels.                                                            |
| 2.4.3 – Focus Order                              |The components on the mood board page follow a natural and logical navigation flow (Download → Add → Inspector → Analysis). The same intuitive sequence applies to the elements in the navbar at the top of each page (Main Page → Collections → Account).                                                                 |
| 2.4.4 – Link Purpose (In Context)                |The link texts are meaningful.                                                              |
| 3.1.1 – Language of Page                         |The default language for each web page is English.                                                              |
| 3.2.1 – On Focus                                 |Focusing elements only updates styling; the component itself remains unchanged.                                                               |
| 3.2.2 – On Input                                 |The mood board is not generated after entering text in the main page's text box until the user presses the Send button.                                                        |
| 3.3.1 – Error Identification                     |The prompt in the text box is flexible, allowing users to generate a mood board based on any aesthetic they choose. As a result, no input errors are generated since the input is open-ended and doesn't follow specific rules.                                                              |
| 3.3.2 – Labels or Instructions                   |The buttons are clearly labeled, and hovering over them displays a tooltip with a more detailed description of their functionality.                                                             |
| 4.1.1 – Parsing                                  |No major code errors.                                                              |
| 4.1.2 – Name, Role, Value                        |All our standard HTML components have a name, role or label.                                                               |
| Colour Part II                                   |The choice of our colors features neutral tones (black, white, grey, cream). For the color palette, the name and the PMS code are included.                                                              |
